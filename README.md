# retail-data-model
<pre>

This is a simplified retail data model intended to demonstrate system performance and diagnosis tk "mr-stats".
It will support both purchases and replenishment, and this will enable sales and inventory analysis of various types.

At this time, the main assumptions made when building this version of the data model are:
- no cancellations
- no returns
- no partial deliveries
- fixed delivery address for purchases/replenishments (obtained from supplier, store, customer dimension tables)

The dialect of the DDL is postgresql.
This is WIP, will add to it as more I run across more use cases.
